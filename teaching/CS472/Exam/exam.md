# Take-Home Exam ðŸ“š

**Important Information:**

I will be assigning an **individual take-home exam**, which will be released **3 weeks before the exam date** on **12/09/2024**.

The exam will require **reflective, evidence-based responses** regarding your software development work this semester. Each answer should include **clear references to your projectâ€™s GitHub repository**, such as links to specific **pull requests, reviews, issues, commits, or comments** to substantiate your responses.

### Important Clarification:
- You **do not** need to come to the exam room for this examâ€”itâ€™s completely **take-home**.
- You can **submit the exam before the exam date** if you finish early. Feel free to submit at any time before the due date.

The **due date** for the exam is **12/09/2024**. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions as the exam date approaches!
