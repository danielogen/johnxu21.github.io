Frequently Asked Questions
=========

### General
* I have no idea how to find a group.
  * During the first weeks, try to ask around who is still without a group.
  * You may form a group of 10 (subject to motivation);
  * You may also (subject to motivation) deviate from the permitted group classification. But then it should be clear to everyone that the expertise in the group is not entirely equal.
  * If you have not found a partner by Thursday, January 26th, please contact <em></em><a href="mailto:john.businge@unlv.edu">Prof. John Businge</a> and the GA <em></em><a href="mailto:wangs12@unlv.nevada.edu">Shizhao Wang</a> by email. We will collect all the names of individuals who have not yet found anyone and then put you in touch with each other.
* Can we also do the first practicals at home? Is it mandatory to come to the physical practicals? 
  * It is not mandatory to come to the physical practicals.
  * The first two practicals are for learning to work with (1) an XML parser and (2) tests and contracts. These exercises are not on point; they are just there to get you started with the software libraries you will need during the project. All the material is listed at the bottom of the [study material](/teaching/CS472/study_material/) tab. The assignments also contain a tutorial that you can follow step-by-step. So you can perfectly do the exercises from home in preparation for the project.
  * From the third practical it is free project work every week.
  * We like to physically organize the first three practicals because we can easily help with technical problems during the installation and use of the software libraries. Once the setup of your project is done, you can independently start the real programming.
* Should we study the three chapters? How does the theory exam work?
  * There is no separate exam for the theory. The final exam is a project defense and is similar to the interim project defenses. We'll go over your code and use the same criteria to evaluate.
* Is the project specification already online?
  * Yes
* Can we still come to the practicals every week?
  * Yes, the computer lab is available for you to work on the project together.
* Do we still get theory lessons?
  * No. The theory lessons are only during the first four weeks.
  * What if a group mate gives up?
  * Contact us as soon as possible. (By the way, this applies to all problems you might have with your group mates) Then we look for an individual solution.
