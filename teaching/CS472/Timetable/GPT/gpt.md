In this lab, you will learn how to leverage ChatGPT for software development tasks. You will also 
learn various ways of sharing you conversation to support collaborative software engineering.

Overview
=======
ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI. It is part of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained 
Transformer) family of models, specifically GPT-3.5-turbo. GPT-3.5-turbo is a highly advanced 
language model that is designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it 
receives.


## How is ChatGPT being used in Software Engineering?
ChatGPT is being used in various ways in the field of software engineering. Its natural language 
understanding and generation capabilities make it a valuable tool for developers, both for 
individual tasks and collaborative projects. ChatGPT has be used to address different tasks in the six phases of SDLC.
Details of the definition of the tasks and how LLMs have been used to address the tasks
can be found in **Section 6** of the paper Hou at al. [LLMs for SE: A SLR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10620.pdf)

1. Requirements engineering tasks e.g.,
  * Anaphoric ambiguity treatment
  * Requirements classification
2. Software design tasks, e.g.,
  * GUI retrieval
  * Rapid prototyping
3. Software development and implementation tasks, e.g.,
  * Code generation
  * Code search
4. Software quality assurance tasks, e.g.,
  * Test generation
  * Failure-inducing test Identification
5. Software maintenance tasks, e.g.,
   * Code review
   * Duplicate bug report detection
6. Software management tasks, e.g.,
  * Effort estimation

In the next three sections, we provide **concrete examples on how developers are using ChatGPT**. We demonstrate two uses how developers incorporate code from ChatGPT:

 - **Use case 1:** Developers incorporate the entire code snippet suggested by ChatGPT into the pull request. This is shown in **Example 1** and **Example 2**.
 - **Use case 2:** Developers pick part of the code snippet suggested by ChatGPT and modifies it to fit their requirement, as illustrated in **Example 3**.

## Use case 1 - Example 1: Duplicate code detection and resolution
In this example, a developer is using ChatGPT in Software maintenance to address the task of **code duplication** in the code. 
Here is the link to both the PR and ChatGPT conversation.

- PR: [https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools/pull/241](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools/pull/241)
- ChatGPT Link: [https://chat.openai.com/share/f09f38e5-f541-4f98-9483-e183f5650398](https://chat.openai.com/share/f09f38e5-f541-4f98-9483-e183f5650398)

`Nostr-tools` is a very active and large repository with over 100 contributors. You can observe 
that the code generated by ChatGPT is adopted by the developer.

**Developer prompt** 
```angular2html
I have some duplication in my TypeScript code. I resolve it, I want to create a discriminated union based
on the keys and values of the interface. My code is blow. Is it possible to do what I want?
```

## Use case 1 - Example 2: Software Configuration Management
This example demonstrates how a developer is using ChatGPT in **Software implementation**  to address the task of **configuration management**

Our use case is `Swarmion`: A set of tools to build and deploy type-safe microservices. 

- PR: [https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/pull/678](https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/pull/678)

As you can observe, the ```CONTRIBUTION.md``` file was updated by simply copying the documentation 
written by ChatGPT.

## Use case 2 - Example 3: Code Generation and Programming Assistance Task
In the example above, the developer utilized the code generated by ChatGPT "as-is". However, in typical scenarios, you usually need to modify or use only part of the code and tailor it to fit your specific use case. The following example illustrates this scenario, where the developer uses only part of the code to suit their need.

Task 1 - Example of Code Generation and Optimization using ChatGPT
=======
To begin using ChatGPT (if you haven't already), simply go to [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/) and create a free account. For this class, the free ChatGPT 3.5 is sufficient.

To effectively use ChatGPT, you should provide it a good "prompt". The concept of ``Prompt Engineering`` is detailed in this research paper: [A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382).
1. Let us use ChatGPT to generate the code for this LeetCode problem  ```Two Sum```: [https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
   * **Simple prompt:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`
  
   ```python
    def two_sum(nums, target):
        # Create a dictionary to store the indices of elements
        num_indices = {}

        # Iterate through the array
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # Calculate the complement needed to reach the target
            complement = target - num

            # Check if the complement is in the dictionary
            if complement in num_indices:
                # If found, return the indices of the two numbers
                return [num_indices[complement], i]

            # Otherwise, store the current element's index in the dictionary
            num_indices[num] = i

        # If no solution is found, return an empty list or raise an exception
        # (depending on the problem requirements)
        return []
   ```

   * Let us give ChatGPT more information:
    -  **Prompt:** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
  
    ```python
    def two_sum(nums, target):
        # Create a dictionary to store the indices of elements
        num_indices = {}

        # Iterate through the array
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # Calculate the complement needed to reach the target
            complement = target - num

            # Check if the complement is in the dictionary
            if complement in num_indices:
                # If found, return the indices of the two numbers
                return [num_indices[complement], i]

            # Otherwise, store the current element's index in the dictionary
            num_indices[num] = i

        # No need to handle the case when no solution is found, as the problem
        # states that there is exactly one solution.

    ```

  You can continue refining the prompt in order to get a more precise and optimized solution. See the full conversation here: [https://chat.openai.com/share/5ed4faed-52c3-45dd-9c6a-1363b3f0dd91](https://chat.openai.com/share/5ed4faed-52c3-45dd-9c6a-1363b3f0dd91)

1. In this second part of task 1, try to use ChatGPT any task of your choice. Observe how designing and refining prompts can help you achieve your goal.
   - Are you able to get your solution?
   - How long did you take to get your answer?
   - What prompting pattern (s) did you adopt? 

Task 2: Sharing Your ChatGPT Conversations on GitHub
====
In this task shows you how to share you ChatGPT conversations with fellow developers. 
Sharing ChatGPT conversations with other developers can be beneficial for several reasons:

- Collaborative Problem Solving
- Learning and Knowledge Sharing
- Code Review and Improvement
- Getting Diverse Perspectives
- Best Practices and Tips
- Avoiding Pitfalls
- Building a Supportive Community
- Ethical Considerations
- Innovation and Exploration

1. Once you are ready to share your converstions, following the screenshots below to generate and copy a 
URL/Link. **Note: Don't worry, your personal profile will NOT be visible after the conversation link is generated, 
it will be automatically changed to ```Anonymous```**.

   <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/share1.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:700px;max-height:700px;" align="center"></p>

   <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/share2.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:500px;height:500px;" align="center"></p>

1. After copying the link, there are many places on GitHub where you can share your conversation (e.g., inside a PR, Issue, or Commit message).
For example, if you used ChatGPT to help you solve a bug, it would be better to add 
the link in the `PR` description or `PR` review comment. See the below:
   - Adding your conversation link in PR description
    
    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/share-review-1.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:800px;max-height:800px;" class="center"></p>

   - Adding your conversation link during PR review activity
    
    <p style="text-align:center"><img src="/teaching/CS472/Timetable/GPT/share-review-2.png" alt="ShareChatGPTConversations" style="max-width:600px;max-height:600px;" class="center"></p>
