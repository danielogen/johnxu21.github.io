## **This individual assignment is due Feb 12th, 2025**


## **üì¢ Introduction**
This **Continuous Integration (CI) Lab** builds upon the work done in the **[Testing lab](../dynamic_analysis)**. In this lab, you will extend your testing process by integrating **GitHub Actions** to automate test execution and enforce code quality checks. CI ensures that code changes are **continuously tested** and **validated** before being merged into the main repository.

By the end of this lab, you will have a **fully automated CI pipeline** that runs your test suite and checks for code quality issues **whenever a change is pushed or a pull request is made**.

## ** Learning Outcomes**
By completing this lab, you will be able to:
‚úîÔ∏è **Set up a GitHub Actions workflow** for Continuous Integration (CI).  
‚úîÔ∏è **Automate test execution** for your repository using GitHub Actions.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Enforce code quality** with Flake8 for Python linting.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Extend test coverage** by adding new test cases.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Resolve merge conflicts** and collaborate efficiently using GitHub.
---

## **üìÅ Repository Setup**
To begin, download the **starter files** from the [CI Lab repository](https://github.com/UNLV-CS472-672/CI) and copy them into the local copy of your fork of the team repository.

# **üîß Step 1: Setting Up GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI)**

## **üìå Overview**
In this step, you will create a **GitHub Actions workflow** to automatically **run tests and enforce code quality checks** whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

GitHub Actions enables automation for:
- Running unit tests on every **push** and **pull request**.  
- Checking for **code style violations** using **Flake8**.  
- Ensuring all test cases pass before merging changes.  

---

## **1. Creating a GitHub Actions Workflow File**
1. Navigate to the **root directory** of your repository.
2. Create the **workflow directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   ```
3. Create the workflow configuration file:
    ```bash
    touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
    ```
4. Open the `ci.yml` file and add the following initial setup:
```yaml
name: CI Workflow  # Name of the workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
## **2. Understanding the Workflow**
- **Triggers:** This workflow runs **on every push** and **pull request** to the `main` branch.
- **Job Name:** The job is named **`build`**, which runs on an **Ubuntu environment**.
- **Checkout Code:** The first step **checks out** the repository so the CI workflow has access to the files.

## **3. Committing and Pushing the Workflow**
### **Add the workflow file to Git:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
```
- Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Added initial GitHub Actions workflow"
```
- Push to the main repository:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## 4. **Check Your CI Workflow**
1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab.
3. You should see your **CI Workflow** listed.
4. ‚úÖ If successful, you should see a **green checkmark** indicating the workflow has run successfully.
5. ‚ùå **If you see an error (red ‚ùå or failure message):**
   - Click on the failed workflow run to view the error logs.
   - Read the logs carefully to identify what went wrong.
   - Common issues and fixes:
     - **YAML Syntax Error:** Ensure proper indentation and correct formatting in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
     - **Invalid GitHub Actions Version:** Check if you're using the latest version (`actions/checkout@v3`).
     - **File Not Found:** Ensure your repository has the correct structure and files in place.
   - If you're stuck, ask for help in the **CI Discord channel**

## **Installing Dependencies & Running Tests in CI**
Now that your GitHub Actions workflow is set up, the next step is to install dependencies, run test cases automatically, and enforce code quality checks.
### 1. Update the GitHub Actions Workflow (`ci.yml`)
Modify your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to include steps for installing dependencies and running tests.

```yaml
      - name: Set Up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"  # Ensure consistency in Python version

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Tests with Pytest
        run: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

### **2. Understanding the New Workflow Steps**
- **Set Up Python:** Ensures the workflow uses Python 3.9.
- **Install Dependencies:** Installs the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Run Tests with Pytest:** Executes all unit tests and generates a coverage report.

### **3. Commit and Push the Changes**
After modifying the `ci.yml` file, commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Added test execution to CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

### **4. Verify Your Tests Run in CI**
1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab and select the latest workflow run.
3. ‚úÖ **If successful, you should see output similar to:**

```diff
==================== test session starts ====================
collected X items
... (list of passing tests)
================== coverage report ===================
```
4.  ‚ùå **If Errors Occur:**
- Click on the **failed workflow run** in the **"Actions"** tab.
- Check the **error logs** to identify the issue.
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed in `requirements.txt`.
- Fix any **failing tests** and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixed failing tests"
   git push origin main

## **Next Step: Enforcing Code Quality with Flake8**
Now that your tests are running in the CI workflow, the next step is to **enforce Python code style and quality checks** using **Flake8**.

### **1. Updating the Workflow to Include Flake8**
Modify your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to add a **linting step**:

```yaml
  - name: Install Flake8
    run: pip install flake8

  - name: Run Flake8 Linting
    run: flake8 src --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
```

## **2. Understanding the Linting Step**
- **Install Flake8**: Ensures that Flake8 is available in the CI environment.
- **Run Flake8 Linting**: Checks for:
  - üî¥ **Syntax errors** (`E9`)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Undefined names** (`F63`, `F7`, `F82`)
  - üìù **General code style issues**

---

### **3. Commit and Push the Changes**
After adding the Flake8 linting step, commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Added Flake8 linting to CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

### **4. Verify Linting in GitHub Actions**
1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab and select the latest workflow run.
3. ‚úÖ **If successful**, the workflow will complete without issues.
4. ‚ùå **If errors occur**, Flake8 will list the violations. Fix them and push the changes.

```bash
# Example: Fix Flake8 issues, then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed Flake8 linting errors"
git push origin main
```

## **üöÄ Refining CI with Branch Protection and PR Reviews**
In this step, we will enforce **branch protection rules**, require passing CI checks before merging, and ensure **peer reviews** on pull requests to improve collaboration and maintain code quality.

---

### **1. Enforcing Branch Protection Rules**
To prevent merging untested or broken code into the `main` branch, follow these steps:

1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Click on **"Settings"** ‚Üí **"Branches"**.
3. Under **Branch Protection Rules**, click **"Add Rule"**.
4. In the **Branch name pattern**, enter `main`.
5. Enable the following protections:
   - ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass before merging** (select your CI workflow)
   - ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
   - ‚úÖ **Include administrators** (optional)
6. Click **"Create"** to enforce these rules.

Now, any new code must pass the CI checks **before** being merged.

---

### **2. Requiring CI Checks Before Merging**
Once branch protection is enabled:
- ‚úÖ **Pull requests cannot be merged unless CI checks pass**.
- ‚ùå **If tests fail**, contributors must fix them before merging.
- üîÑ **If the `main` branch has updates**, contributors must **rebase or merge** to ensure compatibility.

---

### **3. Enforcing Peer Code Reviews**
Code reviews help maintain high-quality contributions. For this lab, each student **must review at least one pull request (PR)** before merging. However, since the changes are minimal, students can approve PRs with a simple comment.

#### **Reviewing a PR**
1. Click on the **PR** you want to review.
2. Go to the **"Files changed"** tab to inspect the code.
3. Click **"Review changes"**.
4. Write a comment in the review box. For this lab, simply write: "**LGTM (Looks Good To Me)** üëç"

5. Click **"Approve"** and **Submit Review**.
6. Once approved and CI checks pass, the author can merge the PR.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** In the **MVP phase**, "LGTM" alone will **not** be allowed‚Äîstudents must provide meaningful feedback.
---

### **4. Submitting a Pull Request**
Now that branch protection is enabled, follow these steps to **submit and review a PR**:

1. Push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin <your-branch>
```
