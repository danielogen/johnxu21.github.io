Course Content
======
This course explains the 'state-of-the-art' reengineering existing software systems. This includes an introduction to the recent research, as well as an overview of the principles techniques and skills applied in practice today. Students will acquire a range of principles, techniques, and skills that are currently being used for reengineering existing software systems. Consequently, the course has a practical ring to it with a minimal theoretical content (taught as reengineering patterns), several lab-sessions (experimenting with a suite of reengineering tools) and one project (restructuring an existing large software system).


Objectives (expected learning outcomes)
======
To goal of this course is to become acquainted with a broad selection of principles, techniques and skills used when reengineering existing software systems. After this course, a student will be able to:
* assess which parts should be reengineered first;
* identify the risks and opportunities for a given re-engineering project;
* extract coarse-grained and fine-grained design models;
* exploit tests during re-engineering;
* select the most appropriate migration strategy;
* solve the typical problems of an object-oriented re-engineering project.

Time schedule
=======
To realize these objectives, the course is organized as follows. We start with an introductory class outlining the state of the art in re-engineering and proceed with a couple of lab sessions (marked with [L] in the detailed time-schedule), in which several reverse and re-engineering tools will be tested under lab conditions. Afterward, students will experiment with these tools and the associated techniques in realistic circumstances by means of a Project, which will also serve as the main outcome.

Milestones

* Announce Project: At the outset of the project, students should announce which software system they intend to reengineer (yes, you can propose one yourself) and whether they intend to do so individually or in groups (duo projects are encouraged).
* Precondition Report - Project Setup. When announcing the project, students should demonstrate that they meet the necessary pre-condition to start the project. They need to have a Git repository for their project and also show the ability to successfully build the project.
* Intermediate Report - Tool Usage: One third into the project, each group should hand in a status report containing screenshots of the tools applied on the project, and interpretations about these results.
* Concluding Session: Two thirds into the project, there is a concluding session, where we will reflect on the lessons learned during the project.
* Final Report: During the exam period you hand in a final report, listing the solutions for the problems you came across and what you learned from them. You will defend this report orally.

Below is the detailed time-schedule, which is subject to change. Changes will be notified over e-mail. [Last modified on August, 11th, 2022.]
