In this session, we will learn about some different tools available for refactoring assistance. By using tools, we can plan ahead the refactorings activities that could improve our design. We will search for bad smells (symptoms of design problems) that give us hints on where and how to refactor. When planning refactoring activities, keep in mind the pattern "Keep it Simple" (OORP, p.37), as it a common mistake for people to over-complicate the design of a refactored artifact. Another important pattern to remember when refactorings is “Most Valuable First” (OORP, p.29), as in you should prioritize the refactorings that bring more benefits first.

During this session, we will perform simple refactoring tasks. However, it is important to remember that for the Reengineering Course we focus on Strategic Refactoring, i.e., we should refactor with a clear reason or goal in mind.
