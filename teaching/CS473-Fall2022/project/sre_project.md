Target Application
==============
[LinkedIn](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka) project is a variant fork of [Apache Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka) running at LinkedIn. 

Kafka was born at LinkedIn. The run thousands of brokers to deliver trillions of messages per day. They run a slightly modified version of Apache Kafka trunk. The [LinkedIn](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka) variant contains the LinkedIn Kafka release.

Assignment
==========

### 1. Contextualization of the Project

LinkedIn is a clone-and-own variant of Apache Kafka that was created by copying and adapting the existing 
code of Apache Kafka that was forked on 2011-08-15T18:06:16Z. The two software systems kept on synchronizing 
their new updates until 2022-02-22T13:32:39Z. Since 2022-02-22T13:32:39Z (divergence date), the two 
projects do not share common commits yet actively evolve in parallel. Currently (2022-02-28T15:01:39Z), 
LinkedIn has 500 individual commits, and Apache Kafka has 3,103 individual commits. Development becomes 
redundant with the continued divergence, and maintenance efforts rapidly grow. For example, if a bug is 
discovered in a shared file and fixed in one variant, it is not easy to tell if it has been fixed in the 
other variant.
