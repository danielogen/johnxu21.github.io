Frequently Asked Questions
=========

### General
* I have no idea how to find a partner.
  * During the first practical, try to ask around who is still without a partner.
  * You may form a group of three (subject to motivation); but then we expect more functionality.
  * You may also (subject to motivation) deviate from the permitted group classification. But then it should be clear to everyone that the expertise in the duo is not entirely equal.
  * If you have not found a partner by Monday 21 February, please contact Prof. John Businge and the Graduate assistant by email. We will collect all the names of individuals who have not yet found anyone and then put you in touch with each other.
