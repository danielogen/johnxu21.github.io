Theory
========
The theory consists of four lessons where we explain the techniques to be used.: 
1. Introduction to Git and GitHub 
2. Reliability, 
3. Object-oriented design, and 
4. Planning

Labs
========
The first exercise lab sessions is meant to practice working with Git and GitHub.
The next lab sessions are aimed at practicing essential topics (XML parsing, testing, debugging, contracts, ...). 
After a few weeks, the lab sessions switch to independent work, i.e. the labs are organized as sessions 
in the computer rooms where you can work on your project freely, and where an assistant is 
present to answer any questions. During those hours, the computer rooms are reserved for you, 
so that you can certainly work.
