Theory
========
The theory consists of three lectures: 
(1. Reliability, 2. Object-oriented design, and 3. Planning) where we explain the techniques to be used.

Practicals
========
The first exercise sessions are aimed at practicing essential topics (XML parsing, testing, debugging, contracts, ...). 
After a few weeks, the exercise sessions switch to independent work, i.e. the exercises are organized as sessions 
in the computer rooms where you can work on your project freely, and where an assistant is 
present to answer any questions. During those hours, the computer rooms are reserved for you, 
so that you can certainly work.
