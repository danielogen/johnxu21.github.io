Current techniques in software design presented with emphasis on architecture first development. Introduction to the processes involved in development. Practice architectural design through a series of homework problems. Students work in teams to prepare the architecture for a software product.

**Prerequisites**: CS 326 and CS 370


* **Level**: Senior 
* **Period**: Spring Semester 2022-2023

Where ? When ?
* Theory & Exercises all during the same time slot
* Time: 
* Location: 
* Labs
  * The labs are organized as sessions in the computer rooms where you can work on your project freely and where an assistant is present to answer any questions. Moreover, the computer rooms are reserved for you during those hours, so you can certainly work.
  * In the first weeks practical "hands-on" lab sessions are organized about the use of certain tools (XML parsing, unit tests, ...)
    * To manage the class, we shall divide the sessions into two groups.

Rationale
======
The purpose of this course is to give students an introduction to developing software in a more realistic setting. In the first semester of the course (CS 472), students gather requirements; creating mockups and prototypes, while in the second (CS 473), they predominately implement and deploy their software. During both courses, students are required to choose and follow standard software engineering processes.

At the end of this course you will be able to...
 * develop a software project using professional tools.
 * guarantee the reliability of a software solution by means of fully automatic tests and contracts.
 * deliver maintainable software based on a good object-oriented design.
 * drawing up and adjusting a plan based on realistic estimates.
 * learn the skills required to develop in a team.

Content
=======
In addition to a theoretical introduction, the content of this course mainly consists of self-motivation. Starting from a requirements specification (which will be expanded and adapted in the project), the student will analyze the problem and design, implement and test a solution. Implementation and testing is done using the C++ programming language.
